3. **Copy and paste** the entire content of `extract-location-data.js`

4. **Press Enter** to run the script

5. **Copy the JSON output** and add it to your `locations.json` file

7. **Click "Copy All"** in the control panel to get all data at once

## üìä What Gets Extracted

- **City name** and **state**
- **Phone number**
- **Neighborhoods** (from Google Maps links)
- **Zip codes** (5-digit patterns)
- **Service areas** (other city links)

## üéØ Example Output

```json
{
  "id": "san-diego",
  "name": "San Diego",
  "state": "CA",
  "fullName": "San Diego, CA",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "areas": [
    "Downtown",
    "Little Italy",
    "Gaslamp Quarter",
    "East Village"
  ],
  "zipCodes": [
    "92101",
    "92102",
    "92103",
    "92104"
  ],
  "extractedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Make sure the page is fully loaded** before running the script
2. **Expand any accordion sections** that contain neighborhoods/zip codes
3. **Use the multi-page script** for efficiency when extracting many locations
4. **Check the console output** to verify the data was extracted correctly
5. **The control panel** will show you progress and total locations collected

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **No neighborhoods found**: Make sure the accordion sections are expanded
- **No zip codes found**: Check if zip codes are visible on the page
- **Wrong city/state**: The script tries to extract from URL first, then page content
- **Script not working**: Make sure you're on a location page with the expected structure

## üìù Integration

After extracting the data:

1. **Copy the JSON output**
2. **Open your `src/data/locations.json` file**
3. **Add the new location data** to the `locations` array
4. **Save the file**
5. **Test the location page** on your website

The extracted data will automatically work with your accordion components and Google Maps integration!
